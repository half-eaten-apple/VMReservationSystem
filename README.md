# VMReservationSystem
Assume You are the administrator of a cloud which hosts some finite number of Virtual Machines. Users of your cloud can borrow or check-out VMs for use. Once they are done using it, they can check-in the VM back. Once a VM is checked in, as an administrator, you should perform some cleanup on the VM and then return it back to the pool of VMs.
